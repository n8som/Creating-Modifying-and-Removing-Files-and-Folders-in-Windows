# Creating Modifying and Removing Files and Folders in Windows

In Windows, files and folders are managed using an application called File Explorer. It presents files and folders in a hierarchical structure and makes it easy to create, copy, move, and delete files. 

I will be showing you how to create and modify folders using File Explorer.

There are two ways to open File Explorer. You can search for it in the search bar.

Or even easier by clicking on the File Explorer icon, found on the Windows taskbar.

On the left-hand side, you can see a list of folders under Quick access. You can add folders by dragging them there. Or remove folders by right-clicking and selecting Unpin from Quick Access from the menu that pops up.

<b>Creating Files and Folders</b>

I'm going to create a folder in the Desktop folder. To do this I first clicked on Desktop, right-click anywhere in the white space, select New, and then Folder.

I named the folder Nathan's Folder. That's how you create a folder in File Explorer. 

Creating a file works the exact same way. Right-click anywhere in the white space, select New, and then this time select Text Document.

<b>Copying, Moving, and Renaming</b>

I will be copying an "Images" folder into the "Pictures" folder. To copy a folder, right-click on the desired folder and select Copy.

Navigate to the desired directory you want to copy your folder into, right-click on the white space, and select Paste.

The folder is now copied into my Pictures folder.

<b>Deleting Files and Folders</b>

To delete a file or folder all you have to do is right-click on your desired item and select Delete.

The folder that has the files/folders you deleted will remain. 

<b>Searching Through Files</b>

File Explorer allows you to search through file contents. You must first enable this feature from the menu of File Explorer. First, access the "View" tab.

Click the dropdown under "Options" and select "Change Folder and Search Options".

Next, select the "Search" tab and check "Always search file names and contents".

File content searching is now enabled. Use the search menu to enter your query. The results will also include file names whose content matches the search query.

That's it! You're now a pro at using Windows File Explorer.
