# Creating-Modifying-and-Removing-Files-and-Folders-in-Windows

In Windows, files and folders are managed using an application called File Explorer. It presents files and folders in a hierarchical structure and makes it easy to create, copy, move, and delete files. 

I will be showing you how to create and modify folders using File Explorer.

There are two ways to open File Explorer. You can search for it in the search bar.

Or even easier by clicking on the File Explorer icon, found on the Windows taskbar.

On the left-hand side you can see a list of folders under Quick access. You can add folders by dragging them there. Or remove folders by right-clicking and selecting Unpin from Quick Access from the menu that pops up.

I'm going to create a folder in the Desktop folder. To do this I first clicked on Desktop, right-click anywhere in the white space, select New, and then Folder.

I named the folder Nathan's Folder. That's how you create a folder in File Explorer. 

Creating a file works the exact same way. Right-click anywhere in the white space, select New, and then this time select Text Document.
